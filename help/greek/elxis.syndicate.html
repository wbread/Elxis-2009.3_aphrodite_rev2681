<h1>Ρυθμίσεις Δελτίων Τύπου<br />(Syndicate)</h1>
<p>This page controls syndication settings for this web site. By the term &#39;syndication&#39; we mean that you will allow other web sites to display and use news from your site. Syndicated news are displayed in other web sites as Titles followed by a short description. Titles act as links to this site. People have to visit your site in order to view the full article. Only content items that are displayed in the Frontpage are used for syndication.</p>
<p>For syndication to work, and people being able to get news from your site, you have to publish the Syndicate module.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="borders">Parameters</h3>
<p><strong>Cache</strong>: Select if syndicated files will be cached or not. If you enable cache, syndicated info will be displayed faster in other web sites and your site will perform better. The drawback is that syndicated news will be updated only every &#39;Cache Time&#39; seconds. If you do not enable cache, syndicated news will be made immediately available to other web sites, but your site&#39;s performance will be degraded, because your site will be queried every time someone visits any site where your News Feed is syndicated.</p>
<p><strong>Cache Time</strong>: This is the number of seconds before your site&#39;s database is checked for updates. The default in Elxis is 3600 seconds, or 60 minutes. After this time has elapsed, the News Feed will refreshes itself from your database thus displaying any new items you have published through the Frontpage.</p>
<p><strong>#Items</strong>: The number of items you want to syndicate and display in your News Feed.</p>
<p><strong>Suyndication Title</strong>: Type the text that you want to be used as title above your syndicated articles, when they are displayed in other web sites. Title will also act as a link to your site.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong>: Type a brief statement to describe your News Feed. If none is entered, it will default to &quot;Elxis site syndication&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Image</strong>: Select an image, from the drop-down menu to be included in your News Feed. Used images are stored in /images/M_images directory.</p>
<p><strong>Image Alt</strong>: Type the ALT text for the image.</p>
<p><strong>Limit Text</strong>: Select if you want to limit the text displayed bellow syndicated content titles. If you select &#39;Yes&#39;, then check the following parameter, otherwise ignore it.</p>
<p><strong>Text Length</strong>: Select the number of words that you want to be displayed bellow syndicated content titles. For no text, enter 0.</p>
