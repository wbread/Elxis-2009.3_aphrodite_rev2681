<h2>Extra Fields</h2>
<p>Extra profile Fields in Elxis are divided in two groups. <strong>Default</strong> and <strong>Extra User 
Fields</strong>.<br />
<strong>Default</strong> are predefined fields that you cannot delete or change.<br />
<strong>Extra User Fields</strong> are custom user fields that you define and are added to the existing ones. 
That way, you can define your own user profile settings, something that is very important for <strong>professional</strong> web sites.</p>
<p>Extra Fields list both types of fields. First you see the Default and bellow them you see the Extra User 
Fields, if any are defined.</p>
<p>You can enable or disable Default fields, using SoftDisk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Contact Information</h2>
<p>In Elxis, you can optionally bind a user&#39;s profile with a Contact Item. Contact Items are used to 
define contact information and display a contact form. You can link a user to a Contact Item  
from <i>Components -&gt; Contact -&gt; Manage Contacts</i>. If you have performed the link, the information 
will be displayed here and a link at the bottom of the box will provide a direct access to the Edit 
Contact page.</p>
