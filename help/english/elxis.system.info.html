<h1>System Information</h1>
<p>The information is displayed in a tabbed format with three main sections of content.</p>
<p><strong>System Info Tab</strong>: This a broad snapshot of the server and versions of the current 
installation components of your Elxis site. Here you will find your PHP build and version, your MySQL 
database version along with the Elxis version and relevant settings that your server has set that might 
interfere with your current site installation. 
Here, you will also find the contents of your Elxis Configuration file (configuration.php). 
This file was created during installation of Elxis, and is changed when you make changes to Global Configuration 
Settings. This file defines many of the global variables that Elxis uses to execute. You can not edit 
the file from here, but it does allow you to look at your current settings to find problems or to 
copy the information for a support post on the support forum.</p>
<p><strong>PHP Info Tab</strong>: PHP is the server side scripting language that Elxis runs on. This language 
is installed and executes on the server and therefore all the settings are made on that server. 
Everything you ever wanted to know about the PHP installation on your Elxis server is listed here. 
How much control you have over changing this information depends on whether you own the server or if your 
server host is willing to work with you on required changes. The PHP tab will allow you to look at all 
the settings and variables that define your PHP installation. It is a good practice to insure that you know 
what requirements are needed for any &quot;Third Party&quot; components that you plan to use with Elxis. 
You can then check for those requirements here.</p>
<p><strong>Permissions Tab</strong>: Displays a list of all Elxis directories that should be writable 
in order for Elxis to function correctly in any case.<br />
<strong style="color:#D00">IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTICE</strong>: Under normal operation, only directories /tmpr 
and /cache should be writable. <strong style="color:#D00">ALL OTHER</strong> directories must be 
<strong style="color:#D00">UNWRITABLE</strong>. You have to make any other directory writable only 
when and for the moment, you want to upload data to it. Immediately after you have to make it unwritable again.<br/>
If you have <strong style="color:#D00">ENABLED FTP</strong>, then you can upload data even when the 
directories are not writable.</p>
