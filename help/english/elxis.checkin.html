<h1>Global Check-in</h1>
<p>When an administrator edits an Item, Elxis changes its status to &quot;Checked Out&quot;. 
In effect, the Item is locked and only the administrator who has &quot;checked it out&quot; has permission to 
work with it. This is a security feature that prevents two administrator from editing the same 
Item document at the same time, thus preventing loss of data upon saving.</p>
<p>Items can be any of: <strong>banners, banner clients, categories, contact details, content items, autonomous pages, 
bots, menu items, modules, newsfeeds, polls, sections or weblinks.</strong></p>
<p>An Item remains &quot;Checked Out&quot; until the administrator clicks &quot;Save&quot; or &quot;Cancel&quot; while editing the Content Item. 
However, if there&#39;s a connection error, administrator presses the &quot;Back&quot; icon in his/her browser, or the administrator makes a selection from the menu 
without saving or canceling the work in progress, the Item remains &quot;Checked Out&quot;. 
This means no one can edit it. This is usually reported or experienced as administrator being unable 
to edit or access items, and can be verified by looking at the column labeled &quot;Checked Out&quot; 
in the Section, Category, or Item file list.</p>
<p>Elxis has a protocol, called &quot;Global Checkin&quot; that allows an administrator to unlock all Items that are currently &quot;Checked Out&quot;.</p>
<p>To perform the &quot;Global Check In&quot;, select System -&gt; Global Check In from the menu. After performing the &quot;Global Check In&quot;, Elxis returns a list showing how many items, and from which tables, were Checked back in.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> Be very careful when doing this, as anyone who is editing a document at that very moment can loose current changes.</p>
