<h1>Site Bots: Bot Manager</h1>
<p>Bots are essentially code snippets which when called via various parameters either activate a program, script or perform a specific function. They can be as simple as a function which replaces typed text with code (such as typing to display an image in a content item) to full fledged third party libraries (such as WYSIWYG editors or other programs).</p>
<p>{mosimage}, {mospagebreak}, {mosflv}, are typical examples of bots.</p>
<p>Each bot has its own set of configuration parameters.</p>
<p>Bots are divided into 4 types, according to for what they are used:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>content</strong> - Inserted into content and replaced by their output when viewing the Front-End.</li>
