<h1>Global Configuration</h1>
<p><strong>Global Configuration</strong> controls Elxis operational settings. Changes made on this screen will 
update <strong>configuration.php</strong> file. <strong>This file must be normally unwritable for security 
reasons</strong>. Change it to writable in order to be able to edit it. Then remember to change it back to 
unwritable (644).</p>
<p>Notice that Elxis next to the page title, shows the current status of configuration.php file. It can be 
eitheir &quot;Writable&quot; or &quot;Not Writable&quot;. 
<p>Check the &quot;Make unwritable after saving&quot; check box to make this file unwritable after saving. 
But the most common way is to use an FTP application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Configuration settings are organized in 11 groups.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="borders">Site Tab</h3>
<p><strong>Site Offline</strong> - Use it to effectively switch on and off this web site&#39;s &quot;Front-End&quot;. 
Use this option when you maintain or update your site to temporarily make it not available to public. Visitors 
will see the message defined in the following parameter.</p>

<p><strong>Offline Message</strong> - This is the message displayed when the site is offline. 
You can change this text to whatever message you want.</p>

<p><strong>System Error Message</strong> - This is the message displayed when there is a technical problem 
with this site (e.g. database connection fails).</p>

<p><strong>Site Name</strong> - This option allows you to specify the name of the site. It will be displayed 
in your browser&#39;s window title and will be used when messages are send from your site.</p>

<p><strong>Components linked with Access System</strong> - This is a very important setting that is directly 
related with access control. Elxis implements an advanced access control system (Site -&gt; Access Manager). 
Using this option, you can define where this access control system will be applied.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>None</strong>: Access control will not be applied.</li>
    <li><strong>Core Components</strong>: Access control will be applied only to core components 
	(components distributed with Elxis).</li>
    <li><strong>Third Party Components</strong>: Access control will be applied only to new components that you 
	have installed.</li>
    <li><strong>All Components</strong>: Access control will be applied to all components (Core and Third Party).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you set the option to None, you are actually disabling the access control checks. If you have already set up 
some rules these will remain but they will not be not used. We advise you to be very careful with option. 
It is one of the things that make Elxis so unique and advanced.</p>

<p><strong>Use Security Images</strong> - Set it to Yes (recommended) if you want Captcha images to appear in 
Elxis forms. Captcha images help you reduce spam mails.</p>

content to which they would not otherwise have access, (that is, content given an Access Level of 
&#39;Registered&#39;. With this option set to &#39;No&#39;, they will only see content with an Access Level of 
&#39;Public&#39;. Access Level setting is defined in various Items parameters.</p>

<p><strong>Allow User Registration</strong> - This option allows you to globally set whether visitors can 
register and create a user account (become registered members).

<p><strong>Use New Account Activation</strong> - If it is set to Yes, an activation link will be sent by email 
to users that are creating a &#39;registered user&#39; account. When users receive the email, they have to click 
the activation link in order to verify that they are real humans. If it is set to &#39;No&#39;, users will be 
able to login right away without activation.</p>

duplicate email addresses. In combination with &quot;New Account Activation&quot;, this option prevents users 
to open several accounts using the same email address.</p>
